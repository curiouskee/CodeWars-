 <!--- You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow. --->


function updateLight(current) {
let light = ["green", "yellow", "red"]

if (current === light[0] ) {
  return light[1]
}
 else if (current === light[1]) {
    return light[2]
  }
  
else if (current === light[2]){
   return light[0]
 }

}
